# PRPD_Bot
PRPD_Bot is a side-project with the intent to make a bot for discord. The bot is able to show information made available by the API of the game League of Legends (LoL) by Riot Games. Here are a few examples of what the bot is able to do: Show summoner information; show live league match information; and appoint roles to players.
The bot is also able to react to certain messages (this is not LoL related).
